Hotline Miami NG (New Game) Bat Generator
=========================================

Source Code: https://github.com/buffet-time/hotlineMiamiBatGenerators

****************************************************************************
The first textfield:   Is to the folder which HotlineMiami actually stores
					   / reads the SaveData from. More info here:
					   http://hotlinemiami.wikia.com/wiki/Save_File
					   
The second textfield:  Is to the folder which holds the SaveData.sav that 
					   you want to copy in that has preset audio levels
****************************************************************************
MAKE SURE YOUR TEXTFIELDS INPUT ARE FORMATTED LIKE THE BELOW EXAMPLES

Example of a proper directory for this program is below:
First Line:    C:\Users\Daniel\Documents\My Games\HotlineMiami\							
Second Line:   C:\Users\Daniel\Documents\My Games\HotlineMiami\hm_saves\metro\audio\ 
(this second line should be a folder preferably located inside of the \HotlineMiami\ folder)

Note that you are just directing it to the folder not adding the SaveData.sav
